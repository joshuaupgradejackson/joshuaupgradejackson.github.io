    <h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

    <p>This document describes some details about me relating to my interactions with other people. It is the reference I use myself, but it is composed to you.</p>
    
    <p>The <a href="#communication">first</a>, <a href="#physical">second</a>, and <a href="#spiritual">third</a> sections apply to everyone. The <a href="chemical">fourth</a> is about drugs and alcohol while the <a href="#hopscotch">fifth</a> relates to kissing girls, and the <a href="#consulting">sixth</a> applies to those who can afford to have me work on their computer problems. I'm reposting this monthly and refining as needed. It is my hope that you will find something here to help optimize your interactions with me and maybe even with other people. You are welcome to adopt any part of this document for your own use, with or without referencing my version.</p>

<h2><a name="communication">Communication</a></h2>

<h3>Crocker's Rules</h3>

<p>I have declared Crocker's Rules. You are invited to speak your mind to me without bothering with politeness or convention. Further details in the quote:
<!-- Citation removed to avoid unintended shock level increases -->

<div class="details" style="border: 1px dashed gray; padding: 6px;">
<p>Declaring yourself to be operating by <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Crocker%27s_rules">Crocker's Rules</a>
means that other people are allowed to optimize their messages for information,
not for being nice to you.&nbsp; Crocker's Rules means that you have accepted
full responsibility for the operation of your own mind - if you're offended,
it's your fault.&nbsp; Anyone is allowed to call you a moron and claim
to be doing you a favor.&nbsp; (Which, in point of fact, they would be.&nbsp;
One of the big problems with this culture is that everyone's afraid to
tell you you're wrong, or they think they have to dance around it.)&nbsp;
Two people using Crocker's Rules should be able to communicate all relevant
information in the minimum amount of time, without paraphrasing or social
formatting.&nbsp; Obviously, don't declare yourself to be operating by
Crocker's Rules unless you have that kind of mental discipline.</p>
<p>Note that Crocker's Rules does <i>not</i> mean you can insult people;
it means that <i>other</i> people don't have to worry about whether <i>they</i>
are insulting <i>you</i>.&nbsp; Crocker's Rules are a discipline, not
a privilege.&nbsp; Furthermore, taking advantage of Crocker's Rules does
not imply reciprocity.&nbsp; How could it?&nbsp; Crocker's Rules are something
you do for yourself, to maximize information received - <i>not</i> something
you grit your teeth over and do as a favor.
<p>"Crocker's Rules" are named after Lee Daniel Crocker.</p>
</div>

<p>You are encouraged but not required to reference Crocker's Rules whenever you are about to make use of them.</p>

<h3>Conversations in confidence</h3>

<p>In general I think I do a reasonable job of not repeating things I hear that the speaker does not want repeated. However, If you would like to share something important with me in confidence, the best way is with sidewalk chalk. We'll draw a big circle, label it "confidence" and sit inside it while having the conversation. This ritual should be fairly effective for keeping the information between us.</p>

<h3><a name="regex">Regular Expressions</a></h3>

<p>Since everyone should, I assume everyone knows basic <a href="https://xkcd.com/208/">regular expressions</a> syntax. In reality this is far from the case, but that's not my fault.</p>

<p>The simplest case may look something like this:</p>

<div class="details" style="border: 1px dashed gray; padding: 6px;">
I just sent yuo this message but it has an error<br />
s/yuo/you/<br />
</div>

<p>The overall structure is the letter s, followed by a separator (usually a forward slash), followed by something to look for, then the separator again, something to replace the found text with, and a final separator.</p>

<h3><a name="ping">Ping</a></h3>

<p>I may at times send you a message that just says '<a href="http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/p/ping.html">ping</a>'. You may respond however you like, but the traditional response is 'pong'. I will usually begin an electronic conversation this way if the actual content of the communication may change depending on when you respond. All hackers know this protocol, and now so do you.


<h3>Encryption</h3>

I am a believer in <a href="http://email.about.com/cs/pgp/a/public_key_enc.htm">public key encryption</a>. <a href="https://keybase.io/pturing/key.asc">My PGP key</a> is available on <a href="https://keybase.io/pturing"</a>keybase.io</a> and <a href="http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x14AC92C1CA4A47D1">the MIT server</a>, and I am available for instant message communications with <a href="https://whispersystems.org/">Signal</a> or <a name="otr" href="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/">OTR</a>. Encrypted video chat is also possible through <a href="https://jitsi.org/">jitsi</a> or <a href="http://www.linphone.org/">Linphone</a>


<h2><a name="physical">I'll take the physical challenge</a></h2>

I do various physical activities regularly and you're probably welcome to play too.

<h3>Yoga</h3>
Hashtag yoga every damn day dot com shebang shebang. #yogaeverydamnday.com#!#!

<h3>Acro Yoga</h3>
Acro Yoga is a combination of Yoga, Acrobatics, and Thai Massage, and it's a lot of fun. <a href="http://youtu.be/bMMlzQsQPk4" class="printshow"><span>This video can give you an idea about acro</span></a>. If you have a desire to acro - if you would like my help - and if you can find me... maybe you can be a flyer... <a href="https://youtu.be/Cn6kEsloMdE?t=22s">on the Upgrade Acro Team.</a>

<h3>Pole Dance</h3>
Pole dance is like partners dancing, but with a very predictable partner. That you can climb on. In India, <a href="http://www.kidzworld.com/article/24642-indian-gymnastics-mallakhamb">Mallakhamb</a> has been around for centuries and was originally an adjunct form of training for (male) wrestlers.



<h3>Other Forms of Dancing</h3>

Blues, Contact Improv, Spontaneous Choreography, Psychic Interlinks

<div class="page-break"></div>

<h2><a name="spiritual">No reliance on virgin or pigeon</a></h2>

<i>We place no reliance<br />
    On Virgin or Pigeon;<br />
    Our method is science,<br />
    Our aim is religion.</i><br />
- Equinox Vol. I. No. 1

<p>A great deal more activity happens in human brains than reaches conscious awareness, and the everyday waking state in which modern humans spend the majority of their time represents only one possible configuration. Our actions are robotic more often than they are not. For most people, their daily moods and activities are governed by a confluence of outside chance events and internal processes of which they are nearly or completely ignorant. Our true potential remains untapped in countless ways.</p>

<p>However, this entire region of human pursuit is so mired in superstition and misinformation that perhaps even a majority of thinking people avoid it entirely.</p>

<p>I have an active interest in meditation, neurofeedback, tantra, sensory substitution, and various related fields. If you're interested in joining me, there are a number of ways that you can.</p>

<h2><a name="chemical">Wine and strange drugs</a></h2>
<i>To worship me take wine and strange drugs whereof I will tell my prophet, & be drunk thereof! ... Be strong, o man! lust, enjoy all things of sense and rapture: fear not that any God shall deny thee for this. </i> - AL II:22<br />
<br />
<i>You may drink, but not to escape problems. (Like the Maltafarians ofthe SubGenius Church, you may only drink to create problems.)</i> -Lord Omar's Introduction to the Principia Discordia

    <p>I no longer take drugs or drink alcohol except under special conditions.</p>

    <p>I cannot consume drugs or alcohol from my own hands or a container but only from the flesh of another consenting person. Body shots, snorting things off of you, and shotgunning are all acceptable. Exceptions to this are made for caffeine, nootropics, anything taken to treat a medical condition under suitable direction as appropriate, religious rituals, and a weekly pass per country. Also I can similarly pass things to you when that aligns with the spirit of the rule.</p>

    <p>This rule is designed to allow me to avoid draining, distracting, or destructive behaviors while still allowing me to use these tools to enhance my life and connect with other people.</p>

<h2><a name="hopscotch">The rules for hopscotch</a></h2>
<i>Ben, you were there less than a day - fifteen hours, about - and you spent over half that time sleeping and playing hopscotch with Dawn
... When, after a week, Jubal had had no other message, he sent a stat care of Ben's office: "What the hell are you doing?" Ben's answer came back, somewhat delayed: "Studying Martian and the rules for hopscotch - fraternally yours - Ben."</i> -Heinlein, Stranger in a Strange Land

<h3>Johnny's Two Rules</h3>

I am pleased to count as a friend a very wise fellow named Johnny. I have adopted <a href="http://johnnysoporno.com/wpireboot/classicwriting.html#tworules">his two rules</a> as my own, though I use my own words to describe them:

<ol>
 <li>I cannot be anyone's sole source of affection.</li>
 <li>You must do your best to get along with anyone else I spend my time with. <em>This includes letting me know when that is difficult for you.</em></li> 
 
</ol>

<h3>The <a href="http://www.subgenius.com/marriage.html">ShorDurMar</a></h3>

Let's get married! I am open to exploring committed relationships. A few conditions here are essential for me to give you the best experience.
<ol>
	<li>You must work with me to make your expectations for the relationship explicit. We'll write it down. Then we'll say it out loud together.</li>
	<li>Such marriage contracts are for a limited time and valid only when consummated.</li>
	<li>Renewals are possible under the same procedure. Currently the maximum term before renewal is two weeks.</li>
	<li>Monogamous relationships are possible! Currently the maximum term for these is 1 hour.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h3>
<a href="http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/30.php">You may be one of the lucky 25</a>. Historically I have often been <a href="http://pturing.livejournal.com/50126.html">uncommonly dense</a> when it comes to reading signs from others and may be pretty bad at making my own attitudes clear. If you want to know if you are eligible to attend naked time, subtlety is not your ally. Here are a couple of options you might try:
<ol>
 <li>Say what you would like in the clearest words possible. Do not fear embarrassment; I will do my level best to honor your invitation with a compassionate response.</li>
 <li>Grab my hand and rub my palm with your fingers until I respond in kind or pull away.</li>
</ol>

<div class="page-break"></div>

<h3>Half known and half concealed</h3>
I am inclined to greet those I like with physical affection. When that involves kissing, some people may draw all manner of strange and unwarranted conclusions. So that I can avoid causing any complications for you, I can show you a hand sign to give when there is anyone around who you are concerned may not understand completely. Also great for the avoidance of transmitting any orally communicable condition you recently had! A later follow-up conversation to clarify actual relevant conditions is recommended.

<h3>Safety Considerations</h3>
I get tested periodically. I am diligent with condom use. Any exceptions must follow under a system along the lines of the <a href="http://caw.org/content/?q=condom">condom compact</a> described by Morning Glory Zell. I've removed some distracting extra words.
<ol>
  <li>All members of the Cadre may have unprotected vaginal or anal sex only with other members of the Cadre. All members of the Cadre must use condoms with any outside lovers. This rule does not apply to oral sex, which at this time is considered safe.</li>
  <li>The Condom Commitment begins with a founding relationship where trust is absolute. Lovers may join only by mutual consent of all involved.</li>
  <li>If a member of the Cadre slips up and has an unprotected fling then they must go through a quarantine period, be tested for all STDs, then accepted back in only by complete consensus of the other members of the Cadre. The duration of the quarantine period shall be determined by the other members of the Cadre based on the most up-to-date medical knowledge available. The same drill applies if a condom breaks during intercourse with an outside lover.</li>
</ol>


<h3>The Veto</h3>

I am <a href="http://sexgeek.wordpress.com/2010/06/21/against-the-veto-or-fear-by-any-other-name%E2%80%A6/">against the veto</a>. This doesn't mean you should avoid sharing your worries and fears with me - quite the opposite. The actual effect of having a veto clause in your relationship is that you end up skipping past the communication and mutual understanding process when difficulties arise, and that isn't healthy. The final conclusion may even be the same but such conversations shouldn't have telling your partner what they can or cannot do as the starting point.

<h2><a name="consulting">Wherever there's trouble</a></h2>

<i>"I came into this game for the action, the excitement. Go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone."</i> - Brazil (1985)

<p>Sometimes I am available for computer consulting work. I can program in any language for any platform and have expertise in Unix administration as well as a little computer security. <a href="https://www.toptal.com/resume/joshua-jackson">My resume is on Toptal's site</a> though it's not necessary to hire me through Toptal if you found me elsewhere.</p>
