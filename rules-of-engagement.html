<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>This is a reference to the rules by which I operate socially and some related information. The <a href="#communication">first</a>, <a href="#physical">second</a>, and <a href="#spiritual">third</a> sections apply to everyone, while the <a href="#sexual">fourth</a> relates specifically to kissing girls, and the <a href="#consulting">fifth</a> applies to those who can afford to have me work on their computer problems. I'm refining and reposting this monthly. It is my hope that you will find something here to help optimize your interactions with me and maybe even with other people. You are welcome to adopt any part of this document for your own use, with or without referencing my version.</p>

<h2><a name="communication">Communication</a></h2>

<h3>Crocker's Rules</h3>

<p>I have declared Crocker's Rules. You are invited to speak your mind to me without bothering with politeness or convention. Further details in the quote:
<!-- Citation removed to avoid unintended shock level increases -->

<div class="details" style="border: 1px dashed gray; padding: 6px;">
<p>Declaring yourself to be operating by <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Crocker%27s_rules">Crocker's Rules</a>
means that other people are allowed to optimize their messages for information,
not for being nice to you.&nbsp; Crocker's Rules means that you have accepted
full responsibility for the operation of your own mind - if you're offended,
it's your fault.&nbsp; Anyone is allowed to call you a moron and claim
to be doing you a favor.&nbsp; (Which, in point of fact, they would be.&nbsp;
One of the big problems with this culture is that everyone's afraid to
tell you you're wrong, or they think they have to dance around it.)&nbsp;
Two people using Crocker's Rules should be able to communicate all relevant
information in the minimum amount of time, without paraphrasing or social
formatting.&nbsp; Obviously, don't declare yourself to be operating by
Crocker's Rules unless you have that kind of mental discipline.</p>
<p>Note that Crocker's Rules does <i>not</i> mean you can insult people;
it means that <i>other</i> people don't have to worry about whether <i>they</i>
are insulting <i>you</i>.&nbsp; Crocker's Rules are a discipline, not
a privilege.&nbsp; Furthermore, taking advantage of Crocker's Rules does
not imply reciprocity.&nbsp; How could it?&nbsp; Crocker's Rules are something
you do for yourself, to maximize information received - <i>not</i> something
you grit your teeth over and do as a favor.
<p>"Crocker's Rules" are named after Lee Daniel Crocker.</p>
</div>

<p>You are encouraged but not required to reference Crocker's Rules whenever you are about to make use of them.</p>

<h3>Conversations in confidence</h3>

<p>In general I think I do a reasonable job of not repeating things I hear that the speaker does not want repeated. However, If you would like to share something important with me in confidence, the best way is with sidewalk chalk. We'll draw a big circle, label it "confidence" and sit inside it while having the conversation. This ritual should be fairly effective for keeping the information between us.</p>

<h3><a name="regex">Regular Expressions</a></h3>

<p>Since everyone should, I assume everyone knows basic <a href="https://xkcd.com/208/">regular expressions</a> syntax. In reality this is far from the case, but that's not my fault.</p>

<p>The simplest case may look something like this:</p>

<div class="details" style="border: 1px dashed gray; padding: 6px;">
I just sent yuo this message but it has an error<br />
s/yuo/you/<br />
</div>

<p>The overall structure is the letter s, followed by a separator (usually a forward slash), followed by something to look for, then the separator again, something to replace the found text with, and a final separator.</p>

<h3><a name="ping">Ping</a></h3>

<p>I may at times send you a message that just says '<a href="http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/p/ping.html">ping</a>'. You may respond however you like, but the traditional response is 'pong'. I will usually begin an electronic conversation this way if the actual content of the communication may change depending on when you respond. All hackers know this protocol, and now so do you.


<h3>Encryption</h3>

I am a believer in <a href="http://email.about.com/cs/pgp/a/public_key_enc.htm">public key encryption</a>. <a href="https://keybase.io/pturing/key.asc">My PGP key</a>  is available on <a href="https://keybase.io/pturing"</a>keybase.io</a> and <a href="http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x14AC92C1CA4A47D1">the MIT server</a>, and I am available for instant message communications with <a name="otr" href="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/">OTR</a>. Encrypted video chat is also possible through <a href="https://jitsi.org/">jitsi</a> or <a href="http://www.linphone.org/">Linphone</a>


<h2><a name="physical">I'll take the physical challenge</a></h2>

I do various fun physical activities regularly. I'm always happy to have friends join me. Here are some of my current interests.

<h3>Yoga</h3>
I try to do yoga every day. I will be happy to meet up to do yoga almost any day.

<h3>Acro Yoga</h3>
Acro Yoga is a combination of Yoga, Acrobatics, and Thai Massage, and it's a lot of fun. <a href="http://youtu.be/bMMlzQsQPk4" class="printshow"><span>This video can give you an idea about acro</span></a>. I have have been known to often attend the Austin Acro Jam on Friday evenings. I also like to catch classes when I can and am willing to play any time there is a soft surface.

<div class="page-break"></div>

<h3>Pole Dance</h3>
I am an avid pole dancer. Since the mid-2000's pole dance is increasingly found outside strip clubs, and is not necesarily more sexual than other forms of gymnastics or dance performance. In India, <a href="http://www.kidzworld.com/article/24642-indian-gymnastics-mallakhamb">Mallakhamb</a> has been around for centuries and was originally an adjunct form of training for (male) wrestlers. However, I didn't know either of those facts when I started, and they have no real bearing on my interest. I have a pole at home and host weekly pole jam sessions. Usually participation is not required.

<h3>Other Forms of Dancing</h3>
I sometimes attend social dance events including swing dance. I'm a very competent lead, though I don't know anything fancy. I love dancing to many forms of EDM, and dabble in hip-hop.

<h2><a name="spiritual">No reliance on virgin or pidgeon</a></h2>

<p>A great deal more activity happens in human brains than reaches conscious awareness, and the every day waking state in which modern humans spend the majority of their time represents only one possible configuration. Our actions are robotic more often than they are not. For most people, their daily moods and activities are governed by a confluence of outside chance events and internal processes of which they are nearly or completely ignorant.</p>

<p>Through meditation and other practices and methods this situation can be altered in a number of interesting and potentially beneficial ways. Further, these techniques may provide opportunities to expand our understanding of our own nature. However, this entire region of human pursuit is so mired in superstition and misinformation that perhaps even a majority of thinking people avoid it entirely.</p>

<p>I am continuously working to expand my knowledge and understanding in this area, and have been doing so for quite some time. If you are interested in psychology, philosophy, meditation, and/or spiritual practices of any sort, then it is likely that I have something very worthwhile to share with you. Be prepared to fall into a very deep rabbit hole.</p>

<h2><a name="hopscotch">The rules for hopscotch</a></h2>
<i>Ben, you were there less than a day - fifteen hours, about - and you spent over half that time sleeping and playing hopscotch with Dawn
... When, after a week, Jubal had had no other message, he sent a stat care of Ben's office: "What the hell are you doing?" Ben's answer came back, somewhat delayed: "Studying Martian and the rules for hopscotch - fraternally yours - Ben."</i> -Heinlein, Stranger in a Strange Land

<h3>Johnny's Two Rules</h3>

I am pleased to count as a friend a very wise fellow named Johnny. I have adopted <a href="http://johnnysoporno.com/wpireboot/classicwriting.html#tworules">his two rules</a> as my own, though I use my own words to describe them:

<ol>
 <li>I cannot be anyone's sole source of affection</li>
 <li>You must do your best to get along with anyone else I spend my time with</li> 
</ol>

<h3>I am not your Boyfriend, or <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/asshole-admits-to-being-asshole-in-supreme-asshole,1172/">Asshole admits to being asshole in supreme asshole move</a></h3>
If you can agree to Johnny's two rules, are in satisfactory mental health, and I'm attracted to you then you are probably welcome at naked time. However, I cannot be anyone's capital-B Boyfriend. I'm not going to call you every day. I'm not going to keep tabs on all your activities. I'm not going to consult you before leaving town. I cannot be and am not interested in being your Boyfriend, nor should you want me to be. Meanwhile, I will never stand in the way of your search for a relationship of that sort, <a href="http://youtu.be/pY8jaGs7xJ0">if that's what you're into</a>.

<h3>Eligibility</h3>
<a href="http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/30.php">You may be one of the lucky 25</a>. Historically I have often been <a href="http://pturing.livejournal.com/50126.html">uncommonly dense</a> when it comes to reading signs from others and may be pretty bad at making my own attitudes clear. If you want to know if you are eligible to attend naked time, subtlety is not your ally. Here are a couple of options you might try:
<ol>
 <li>Say what you would like in the clearest words possible</li>
 <li>Grab my hand and rub my palm with your fingers until I respond in kind or pull away</li>
 <!-- <li>See if you can signal me through <a href="http://bangwithfriends.com/">a popular website that exists for this purpose</a> - though there is a chance of a false positive or false negative here for technical reasons, including the inability to unselect a friend</li> -->
</ol>

<h3>Half known and half concealed</h3>
I am inclined to greet those I like with physical affection. When that involves kissing, some people may draw all manner of strange and unwarranted conclusions. So that I can avoid causing any complications for you, I can show you a hand sign to give when there is anyone around who you are concerned may not understand completely. Also great for the avoidance of transmitting any orally communicable condition you recently had! A later follow-up conversation to clarify actual relevant conditions is recommended.

<h3>Safety Considerations</h3>
I get tested periodically, and a brief conversation about testing is recommended before sex with any new partner. I am diligent with condom use. Any proposed exceptions to this must follow under a system along the lines of the <a href="http://caw.org/content/?q=condom">condom compact</a> described by Oberon Zell. To wit:
<ol>
  <li>All members of the Cadre may have unprotected vaginal or anal sex only with other members of the Cadre. All members of the Cadre must use condoms with any outside lovers. This rule does not apply to oral sex, which at this time is considered safe.</li>
  <li>The Condom Commitment begins with a founding <strike>Primary</strike> relationship where trust is absolute. <strike>Long-term Secondary</strike> lovers may join only by mutual consent <strike>of both Primaries and any other Secondaries who already belong.</strike></li>
  <li>If a member of the Cadre slips up and has an unprotected fling then they must go through a quarantine period, be tested for all STDs, then accepted back in only by complete consensus of the other members of the Cadre. The duration of the quarantine period shall be determined by the other members of the Cadre based on the most up-to-date medical knowledge available. The same drill applies if a condom breaks during intercourse with an outside lover.</li>
</ol>

Their document also calls for a written agreement, which I do not currently consider essential. The stricken text here is my modification. I do not think hierarchical primary/secondary relationships are optimal or should be assumed. I am <a href="http://sexgeek.wordpress.com/2010/06/21/against-the-veto-or-fear-by-any-other-name%E2%80%A6/">against the veto</a>.

<h2><a name="consulting">Wherever there's trouble</a></h2>

<i>"I came into this game for the action, the excitement. Go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone."</i> - Brazil (1985)

<p>I am available for computer consulting work. I can fix your computers and I can make them do new things. Some of the things I am particularly good at are 
described in a <a href="joshjackson-capabilities.pdf">separate document</a>. I am available for travel. Currently my standard rate is $150/hr, and I have ample work so I am very selective about my projects.</p>
