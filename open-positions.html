    <h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

    <p>Upgrade has several active plans and projects which could benefit from the addition of collaborators and co-conspirators.</p>
    
    <!-- ---------------- --> 

    <h2><a name="interactionproxy">Interaction Proxy</a></h2>

    <p>Upgrade has high force multipliers when operating online and through keyboard driven interfaces. This means all voice communications and physical world tasks not involving body maintenance or pleasures of the flesh are relatively expensive if performed by Upgrade himself.</p>

    <p>The Interaction Proxy will handle interactions with humans as well as objects in the physical world.</p>

    <h3>Qualifications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Possess a humanoid body able to navigate and manipulate human environments well</li>
        <li>Ability to deploy said body to locations in Austin, TX on short notice</li>
        <li>Excellent written and verbal English communication skills</li>
        <li>Must have no issues with the multiple eccentricities of Upgrade's lifestyle choices</li>
        <li>Interested in working a few hours a week on an hourly basis</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- ---------------- -->

    <h2><a name="dominantfrequencyrevolution">Coder/Psychonaut - Dominant Frequency Revolution</a></h2>

    <p>Dominant Frequency Revolution challenges you to make your own brainwaves do arpeggios through a top scrolling neurofeedback game. May or may not lead to superpowers in the realm of arousal control.</p>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>The candidate must be minimally proficient in at least one programming language. No particular skill or talent is required but you should be able to make small changes to a simple working program to meet your own needs.</li>
        <li>Must possess an enthusiasm for turning levers in your own brain's state in a way nature never intended.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="transhumancolorperception">Vision Upgrade Pioneer - Transhuman color perception</a></h2>

    <p><em>"To boldly know What Mary Didn't Know"</em></p>

    <p>In the vulgar conception, color is the experience of particular frequencies of light. In reality we have known since Newton that there is no color in the light. It is not possible to produce all the colors we experience using individual frequencies of light, and we rarely encounter a single frequency of light on its own except when dealing with lasers. The colors we see result from mapping mixtures of light to a roughly three dimensional space that is a fabrication of our brains and has no basis in the external world. There is no reason other than ignorance and the failure of our imaginations to suspect that the colors we experience are all that are possible.</p>

    <p>Since 2010 we have had clear proof of the existence of human tetrachromats. This occurs naturally only in women and is rare, but through psychophysical modeling it has been shown that some of these women perceive an additional independent dimension of color. Since they were not previously "normal" trichromats they cannot compare their experience to ours well but we do find them using multiple color terms to describe their visual experience of a single point in space.</p>

    <p>In 2012 it was shown that it is not necessary for additional inputs to be present during early childhood development; with gene therapy it is possible to expand the color perception of an adult primate.</p>

    <p>Using a method dating back to 1855 with the work of James Clerk Maxwell, in 2014 our team was able to non-invasively induce a novel color experience in an adult human. This subject reported seeing a color that was between red and orange but which was not reddish orange.</p>

    <p>Based on our models it should be possible to use this method to bring about human pentachromacy resulting in color experiences beyond those experienced by any human before.</p>

    <p>We are currently seeking a Python programmer for paired programming work to re-validate our simulations prior to the next experiment.</p>

    <h2><a name="thirdpersonvision">Vision Upgrade Pioneer - 3rd person vision</a></h2>

    <p>Recent advances in low latency video systems allow for high definition real time 3rd person vision upgrades.</p>

    <p>In the first experiments it is demonstrated that skill uptake with pole dance and martial arts is accelerated by the training advantage of third person vision.</p>

    <h3>Qualifications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>At least 200 hours of psychedelics experience</li>
        <li>An interest in pole dance or martial arts</li>
    </ul>

    <p>See the world, the Upgrade way.</p>

    <h3>Qualifications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The ideal candidate is able to travel at will and is free from or ready to suspend fixed location responsibilities such as pets, children, or conventional employment. Weekend only applications will be considered, but extended availability is preferred.</li>
        <li>Must be able to lift 50 lbs, bend, stretch, stand for extended periods of time, climb stairs, reach, twist, sit, walk, and run.</li>
        <li>Foreign language skills are a plus. Particularly looking for Spanish, Russian, Portuguese, and Khmer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Travel to ancient and modern ruins, sacred spaces, disaster sites, open air markets, beaches, and night clubs around the world.</li>
        <li>Research local opportunities and logistics including food, transportation, lodging, and entertainment.</li>
        <li>Maintain a social media presence. Take and appear in exceptional photos for Instagram and other platforms.</li>
