<p>Through some combination of my tech experience, my psychology studies, work in and out of the Eagleman Neuroscience Lab, amazing friends, and a healthy diet of burner art projects and science fiction literature, I have an abundance of promising projects. Some are just ideas and some are ready to become products or performances. Progress on many of them requires the right collaborators. Here is a partial list.</p>

<h1>EEG and Neurofeedback Projects</h1>

The advent of consumer EEG devices which provide good outputs and are easy to use provide a number of new opportunities. I have done significant research into these possibilities and written some relevant software modules. You can see some of the code that I've released publicly at <a href="https://github.com/AmbrosIA-Institute">https://github.com/AmbrosIA-Institute</a>.
